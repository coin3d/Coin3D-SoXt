SoXt 1.1.0 Released

We release SoXt 1.1.0 now because it was high time to declare the API
frozen and have a branch of SoXt that should be considered stable,
and consequently also have a branch that is to be considered more
experimental than what the old situation was.

SoXt 1.1.0 is released with some known limitations with regards
to compatibility with SGI's libSoXt (aka libInventorXt).  We have
not attempted to be fully feature complete with libSoXt, but we
have includes compatible versions of the most essential and commonly
used components.

SoXt 1.1.0 is also released with known bugs, a couple of which are
quite serious (but very system-specific).  They have been assessed,
and judged to be fixable without consequences for future binary
compatibility of the library, so they will hopefully be fixed in
a subsequent patchlevel release of SoXt 1.1.

The version number has been set to 1.1.0 because this release of
SoXt has features not found in SoQt 1.0 but which will appear in
the future SoQt 1.1.  We want to try to keep version numbers and
feature sets in sync between the various GUI toolkits.
